The goal of the game jam was to design and develop games in [AMOS Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)). Participants installed and used [AmigaForever](https://www.amigaforever.com/), graciously offered by Cloanto, and [AMOS Professional](https://www.powerprograms.nl/amiga/amiga-all-about-amos.html). They learned from two pre-made games, a simple [Piano](/GameJam/Piano/) game and a [platformer](/GameJam/Platformer).
