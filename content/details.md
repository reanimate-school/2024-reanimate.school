# From Code Lines to Creative Leaps: The Evolution of Game Development
## By Carlos Pinto Gomez

In the keynote "From Code Lines to Creative Leaps: The Evolution of Game Development," we will embark on a detailed exploration of how game development has evolved from the complex, code-centric approaches of its inception to today's innovative methodologies like visual scripting that significantly lower the barrier to entry. The session will thoroughly examine pivotal moments in video game history, highlighting the evolution of game development methodologies and the technical challenges faced by pioneers in the field.

As we navigate the historical timeline, emphasis will be placed on the development of game systems, with a focus on comparing technologies used for integrating other systems such as sound, visual effects, and animations. We will explore how advancements such as visual scripting have simplified the use of these complex systems, particularly in versatile engines like Unreal, Unity, and Godot. Additionally, we will discuss how these technological shifts have influenced production methodologies, transitioning from traditional waterfall models to agile frameworks that facilitate rapid prototyping and iterative development.

These tools have not only streamlined the development process but also expanded the creative possibilities by enabling a diverse range of creators, including artists and designers without formal coding backgrounds, to bring their visions to life. This democratization of game development is accelerating time to market, allowing studios to gather player feedback earlier, and thereby enhancing game quality through real-world testing; as covered by our featured case studies of successful games that exemplify the impact of these modern methodologies on both the development workflow and the end product.

Join us as we trace the evolution from intricate code lines to expansive creative leaps, exploring how the advancement of development tools has transformed the way games are made and expanded the very horizons of the gaming industry.


# Haunted Vertices and Low Poly Frights – PS1 Aesthetic as Zombie Media, Hauntology, and Glitch Horror
## Frédérick Maheux

The original PlayStation console, despite ceasing production in 2006, continues to exert a profound influence on alternative games culture. New assets, shaders, and tools emulating its unique aesthetics are constantly proposed across various game engines. The popularity of demakes, and low poly reinterpretations of critically acclaimed games such as Bloodborne (From Software, 2015), is a testament to this enduring influence. This trend extends beyond video games. Petscop (Tony Domenico, 2017), a YouTube horror series presented as a Let's Play of a fictional haunted game, is but one example of the lasting allure of PS1-era aesthetics. While the console saw the release of seminal horror games such as Resident Evil (Capcom, 1996) and Silent Hill (Konami, 1999), more obscure Japanese titles such as Germs Nerawareta Machi (KAF, 1999) and Kowai Sashin (Media Entertainment, 2002) are being fan translated and generating popular content for video creators on YouTube and Twitch.

This presentation will analyze the fascination with the original PlayStation console and how its unique 3D aesthetic still carries a massive affective appeal for horror fans and game creators. Three theoretical frames will be explored:
- First, Jussi Parikka and Garnet D. Hertz's concept of zombie media: how the obsolete can be used as a media archeology – more precisely, a revisiting of the hidden aesthetics potentials of past technology.
- Mark Fisher's reworking of Derrida's hauntology, the trace of a lost future and potentials in media's retrospection, will then be invoked to see how this nostalgia inspires the production of games that could not exist to rethink the future of video games.
- Finally, the potential of glitches and errors in horror titles as an affective "vengeance" from game designers to express personal emotions.

These three concepts will serve as a lens to understand the creations of various communities where PS1 aesthetics is central, such as Haunted PS1 and Domino Club. Titles from Modus Interactive, Colorfiction, and Valerie Dusk will be shared to vividly illustrate the limitless and captivating creative possibilities of the PS1. 



# Speedrunning the Amiga legacy: 6605 games (and counting)
## By Carl Therrien

This presentation will introduce fifteen video games selected to create an Amiga Arcade for ReAnimate. The objective is to get in touch with inspiring game designs that have disappeared from view despite their critical appreciation at the time of their release. Through this assemblage, the games enter into a dialogue, shedding light on each other. In the Amiga Arcade, a lot of folks run, gun, and slash; Arnold Schwarzenegger stands next to the Giana sisters and their punk superpowers; pinball becomes a funky tool to play with music samples; lemmings explode in a way that announces the fury of Grand Theft Auto; a raver girl fights off capitalism and pollution by shooting love; and Maria Renard revives nearly 30 years after her initial appearance in the Castlevania series, seeking revenge in a fan-made game released exclusively for the Amiga in 2023. Thanks to the Scorpion Engine, created by Erik Hogan from New Zealand, coding special effects on the platform has become easier than ever, thus opening up a new development cycle in the platform’s extended lifespan.   

Fan-curated resources were essential to discover and connect with these games, for example, the Hall of Light database guiding us to original game reviews from the videogame press, and the "All Games" channel (emerging from Poland), providing video overviews of all titles released on a specific platform. For the Amiga, this visual synthesis runs for over seven hours and 25 minutes. These resources, among others, encouraged us to integrate as many titles as possible in the arcade and this presentation. Finally, each selected game will be related to specific academic contributions emerging in the last twenty years of game studies, hoping to put these games on our radar and, most importantly, hear what they say about video game culture.
