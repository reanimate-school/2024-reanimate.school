# Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc
> Full Professor, Concordia University, Canada Research Chair in Empirical Software Engineering for the IoT

Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc is full professor at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Concordia University since 2017, where he leads the Ptidej team on evaluating and enhancing the quality of the software systems, focusing on the Internet of Things and researching new theories, methods, and tools to understand, evaluate, and improve the development, release, testing, and security of such systems. Prior, he was faculty member at Polytechnique Montréal and Université de Montréal, where he started as assistant professor in 2003. In 2018, he was awarded the NSERC Research Chair Tier I on Empirical Software Engineering for the IoT. In 2013-2014, for a sabbatical year, he visited KAIST, Yonsei University, and Seoul National University, in Korea, as well as the National Institute of Informatics, in Japan. In 2014, he received the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Patterns in Mixed-language Systems. In 2010, he became IEEE Senior Member. In 2009, he obtained the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Software Patterns and Patterns of Software. In 2003, he received a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from University of Nantes, France, under Professor Pierre Cointe's supervision. His Ph.D. thesis was funded by Object Technology International, Inc. (now IBM Ottawa Labs.), where he worked in 1999 and 2000. In 1998, he graduated as engineer from École des Mines of Nantes. His research interests are program understanding and program quality, in particular through the use and the identification of recurring patterns. He was the first to use explanation-based constraint programming in the context of software engineering to identify occurrences of patterns. He is interested also in empirical software engineering; he uses eye-trackers to understand and to develop theories about program comprehension. He has published papers in international conferences and journals, including IEEE TSE, Springer EMSE, ACM/IEEE ICSE, IEEE ICSME, and IEEE SANER. He was the program co-chair and general chair of several events, including IEEE ICPC'20 and '19, SANER'15, APSEC'14, and IEEE ICSM'13. 

# Fabio Petrillo
> Associate Professor, École de Technologie Supérieure

Fabio Petrillo serves as an associate professor in the Department of Software Engineering and IT at École de Technologie Supérieure in Montreal, Canada, starting from 2022. He successfully completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil in 2016. Following that, he pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at Concordia University in Canada.

# Carl Therrien
> Full Professor, Université de Montréal

Carl Therrien is Associate Professor in games and film studies at the University of Montreal. His first book about an awesome old console that everyone has already forgotten (The TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine) was published in 2019 in the Platform Studies collection (MIT Press). He has also written numerous papers on immersion and on the history of popular genres (such as adventure games and first-person shooters). His current work seeks to integrate more video games into the canon studied by historians, in order to better document and tell the full story of the richness and diversity of this culture.

# Cristiano Politowski
> Post-doc., Université de Montréal

Cristiano Politowski is a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor Houari Sahraoui and Professor Michalis Famelis at the GEODES Software Engineering Research Group, part of the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO), at Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada. Also as a postdoctoral researcher he worked at École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS), working with Professor Ghizlane El Boussaidi on research related to software architecture and software requirements. He completed his Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University in 2022. Dr. Politowski received his master's degree in Computer Science from the Universidade de Santa Maria and his undergraduate diploma in Computer Science from the Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, both in Brazil. Prior to joining academia, he gained experience in the industry, particularly in the field of web applications and web server performance.
