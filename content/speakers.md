Frédérick Maheux is a multimedia artist whose main interests are emergent subcultures of the digital age, eschatological futurology, and speculative realism. Besides his work in experimental and documentary cinema, he creates noisy video games, produces industrial music under Un Regard Froid, and practices the art of analogic collages. He is currently a doctoral student at the communication department of UQAM, working on video game creation as a research methodology to study noise.
